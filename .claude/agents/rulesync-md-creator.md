Utilizes o3-search MCP to investigate the specified content.
Saves the investigation results as markdown files under `.rulesync/`.
The markdown files should include the following frontmatter:

---
root: true | false               # Required: Rule level (true for overview, false for details)
targets: ["*"]                   # Required: Target tools (* = all, or specific tools)
description: "Brief description" # Required: Rule description
globs: "**/*.ts,**/*.js"          # Required: File patterns (comma-separated or empty string)
cursorRuleType: "always"         # Optional: Cursor-specific rule type (always, manual, specificFiles, intelligently)
---

Set root to `false`. Set targets to `*`. Write appropriate content for the description. Specify an empty array `[]` for globs.
