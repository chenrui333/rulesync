 * - Converting from RulesyncCommand to tool-specific format
 * - Converting from tool-specific format back to RulesyncCommand
 * - Loading commands directly from tool-specific files

 * Concrete implementations should handle:
 * - Tool-specific frontmatter structure and validation
 * - Tool-specific file naming conventions
 * - Tool-specific body content formatting
